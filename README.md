<p>I'm one of those kids who grew up adoring Apple and decided to become an **iOS developer**. I've built apps that have gained tens of thousands of downloads and revenue, but my aim remains to build solutions to problems I face and scale it for everyone else to use. I'm also into web development, but that's mainly to help small businesses build their presence online. Since my work was starting to get a little too "front-end oriented", I decided to start learning a bit of Go to feel like I'm doing something important.</p>
